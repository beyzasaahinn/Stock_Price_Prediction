Tesla Stock Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the closing prices of Tesla's stock in the market.
By utilizing a dataset containing historical data of Tesla's stock prices, we will develop a model to forecast future stock closing prices.

Project Description
In this project, we will use a dataset containing daily stock information for Tesla from June 2010 to February 2020.
Using this data, we will build a predictive model based on historical stock prices and volume information.
Our goal is to use this model to predict future stock closing prices.

Dataset Details
The dataset consists of 2,416 observations and 7 variables. Each observation includes the following information:

Date: Represents the date of the relevant trading day.
Open: Represents the opening price of the stock on the relevant trading day.
High: Represents the highest price of the stock on the relevant trading day.
Low: Represents the lowest price of the stock on the relevant trading day.
Close: Represents the closing price of the stock on the relevant trading day.
Adj Close: Represents the adjusted closing price of the stock on the relevant trading day.
Volume: Represents the trading volume of the stock on the relevant trading day.

Methods and Models Used
In our project, we will use machine learning and time series analysis methods to make stock price predictions. 
We will focus on deep learning models and aim to develop the most suitable model for future price predictions.
